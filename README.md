## A bit of Myself
I am a junior Full-Stack developer that has built this project to gain more experience in the languages (REACT), (C#), (SSMS) and it has been quite fun building it, 
it has  been very stressful in the process but one major soft-skill that I have learnt was to never complicate simple work. 
Even in the Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC).
